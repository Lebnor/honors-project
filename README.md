# bootstrap honors project
 
This is a simple project mimicking an atricle / blog-post

The goals of this project are to solidify and demonstrate the skills I learned
while taking coursera's front-end bootstrap course.

Seems like Bootstrap CSS doesn't load, so in the meantime I uploaded this
site on netlify: https://focused-haibt-c6525b.netlify.app/?#topic3 .
